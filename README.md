# 10-23-prework-study-guide

## Description

The motivation behind this Prework-Study-Guide was to create a study guide for coding bootcamp students. I built this project because I wanted to create a guide where I could easily find and read all the relevant notes about the subjects I learned in the prework modules. The study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, GIT, and Javascript. 

## Installation

"N/A"

## Usage

To use the Prework-Study-Guide you can review the notes in each section. There are four sections and they are titled HTML, CSS, GIT, and Javascript respectively. If you would like a suggestion on what topic to study first, you can open up the Chrome DevTools by following the following keyboard commands (Mac)   Command+Option+I
(Windows / Linux)	F12 or Control+Shift+I. A console panel will open and there you will be able to see a list of all the topics/technologies we learned in the Prework modules and you will also be able to see a suggestion of which topic to study first!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
